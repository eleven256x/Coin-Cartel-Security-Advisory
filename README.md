### Vulnerability Scope:
> This vulnerability affects all Coin Cartel Paid & Crack users using any related Coin Cartel Script Product(s).

### Description:
> The software provider (Blitzkreig/Blitz/Coin Cartel LLC) can (Was functional before the script leak) use a hidden backdoor built into one of their dynamicly loaded module files to silently capture your Session IDs on initialization. Though every script provider has this functionality and ability to do so, Coin Cartel LLC has actually decided to actually implement one for no real apparent reason. After looking into it, It uses your client's Session ID as an authoritnzation token for their backend redemption server ("redeem.coincartel.io")
